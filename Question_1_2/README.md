# Question 1

> *DBs:* testing DBs, Linux/CLI, general terminal/scripting, etc: load simple user data and metadata into the following, making sure each DB is “properly” set up:
>
>   1.1. SQL: choose between MySQL or PostgreSQL.
>
>   1.2. NoSQL: choose between MongoDB, Redis.
>
>   1.3. Graph: choose between Neo4J, OrientDB.
>
>   1.4. Basic data and metadata to be loaded to each one of the DBs above: User Data and Metadata: username, passwd, selected keywords (name, last name, list of colors).
>
>   In addition to the above, add the below data and metadata to each of the chosen DBs (1 SQL, 1 NoSQL, 1 Graph) above:
>
>        - Create a DB to accumulate different family events: DB name == 'events'
>        - Using the 'events' DB, create a field to accumulate different types
>            of events: Thanksgiving , Potluck , Birthday .
>        - Each event should should contain the following relevant fields:
>            Name , Food , Confirmed , Sign Up Date .

>            Sign Up Date: pick as desired.

## Solution

# Question 2

> *Python:* testing Python 3, ORMs, code quality, etc: write ​[Python] ​code to connect to the above DBs and list its contents.
>   *Bonus* for using appropriate ORMs.
>   *Extra Bonus:* using Pandas as backend.
> > In Python, write code to connect with the above DBs, and list its contents. Feel free to use ORMs, Pandas, etc.
